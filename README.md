# Discord.Bot

This project was used to play around with creating a discord bot with the idea of playing music using dsharp.

This was done during my furlough in 2020 as a passion/learning project.

Unfortunatly due to advances in packages and api this solution no longer works. 

Note - The bot token to use the bot has been reset and will not work.

To hide this is future solution should this ever be used would be the use of environment varibales on the hosting machine therefore the code would not contain the token.
